# Air Quality Index (AQI) of Vietnamese cities/provinces

This is a data visualization project about AQI data in some cities/provinces of Vietnam. 
- Visualization tool used: Tableau
- Dataset: The selected dataset includes 8 csv files of some popular air quality indexes of 8 cities/provinces in my home country (Vietnam). They are some statistics recorded over several years, in which some are from 2014 to 2021 and some are from 2019 or 2020 until now. 

- Note: This dataset comes from https://aqicn.org/
8 csv files are downloaded from this website, then they are put in 1 Excel file as 8 sheets. After that, Tableau is used to create a union of 8 worksheets to generate a dataset which is easy to use in this visualization tool. In this dataset, there are many indexes. However, the dashboards only focus on two main pollutants which are PM25 and PM10. Especially for Ho Chi Minh City, there is only PM25 because of the limitation of the data sources.

- For the visualization's story: it can be read from the .docx file in the "Documentation" folder.
